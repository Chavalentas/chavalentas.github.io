                <p>Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Stefan and I live in Austria.
                    During my studies at the FH Wiener Neustadt and during my internship, I was able to learn many useful skills that I believe are in high demand in today's IT world.
                    I have demonstrated my commitment to computer science during my internship and on many projects I have created.
                    My studies and my own interests have given me a lot of knowledge in the field of clean programming, software architecture and also machine learning.
